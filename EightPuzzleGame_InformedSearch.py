"""
This class implement the Best-First-Search (BFS) algorithm along with the Heuristic search strategies

In this algorithm, an Open list is used to store the unexplored states and 
a Closed list is used to store the visited state. Open list is a priority queue (First-In-First-Out). 
The priority is insured through sorting the Open list each time after new states are generated 
and added into the list. The heuristics are used to decide which node should be visited next.

In this informed search, reducing the state space search complexity is the main criterion. 
We define heuristic evaluations to reduce the states that need to be checked every iteration. 
Evaluation function is used to express the quality of informedness of a heuristic algorithm.
